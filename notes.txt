Next
- Ability to define teams and add IDs to them.
	- Pull team members from DB.
	- New form for creating and updating teams.
	- Send form to DB to create new team row.
	- How?
		- get calendarList (PM must manually add coworkers through gcal interface? Or can that be handled through API?)
		- select or create team to update
		- add and remove calendarids from teams

-----

- Navigation is single page, but different filters are reflected in the address bar as params.  Goal is to allow forward and backward navigation in a single page.
- Load elements from external php files via ajax.
? How to determine who is a member of which team? Hard-code IDs into arrays? Seems to remove some of the flexibility. Can a user create groups of imported calendars in their G cal?  Nope.  Looks like I'll need to add a limited php backend + DB for this functionality.
